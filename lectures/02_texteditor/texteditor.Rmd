## Important principle 

.center[
  .large[
    Don't touch that mouse!
  ]
]

???

Pointing-and-clicking is not reproducible! 

Moreover, every time you have to reach for the mouse, there's a 
loss of efficiency. Saving 1 second on something you do 50 times a
day means saving about five hours per year. You're going to be writing
code the rest of your career. Ten years from now, do you want to look
back and realize you spent two days of time reaching to and from your mouse?

## Choosing an editor

A good editor...
* does not require pointing and clicking;
* makes it easy to get code to `R` (or a terminal, etc...);
* has syntax highlighting;
* indents code automatically;
* simultaneously view code across files; 
* has a full suite of (customizable) hot keys.

.red[Microsoft Word is not a good editor.]

???

The choice of an editor is personal. Some people take the choice of editor
far too seriously (like on the next slide, where my distaste for RStudio will
undoubtedly spill over). Most editors these days can be customized in myriad ways, 
such that the difference between editors is becoming smaller.

## Good editors

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
* [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

I use Sublime Text 97% and vim 3%. 
* Work remotely? Know *at least some* vim or emacs.

RStudio is an OK editor for `R`-related tasks. 
* There are better options (in my opinion).

## Hot keys

Make yourself start using them now!
* Not just in your text editor.
* Moving between browser tabs, applications, etc...
* Don't touch that mouse!

???

Your work productivity hinges on how fast you can operate a computer. 
Force yourself to learn to be more efficient. It's frustrating at first --
I can't tell you how many times I've googled "sublime hotkey for ...". 
But make it part of your routine. 

---

## Hot keys

Know how to:
* save, save all (and do, __after every command__!)
* open file (better: navigate open file directory panel)
* undo/redo
* move between tabs/panes/applications
* highlight a word/the next word/the line
* highlight all instances of a word
* copy/cut/paste words/lines
* duplicate lines

???

I compulsively hit the hot key for save when I'm typing anywhere. Learn to 
do that and you'll save yourself a lot of pain. 

Be annoyed every time you have to touch your mouse. Ask yourself, "What was
I trying to do when I had to touch the mouse? Can I automate that?" 

As you become more advanced, start shaving off even more time -- "Is there a 
way I could do this command with two keys instead of one?" Learn new hotkeys!
Customize your hotkeys (if your editor allows). 

If you use sublime text, learn to navigate through the command palette 
(super+shift+p), type one or two letters of command.

---

## Hot keys

Know how to...
* find/replace text in a file/folder
* find/replace text in a folder
* cursor to start/end of current line
* cursor to the next word in a line
* comment out lines/sections
* write your own hotkeys! (editor permitting)

class: title-slide, center, inverse, middle
background-color: #487f84

*Don't stress over picking an editor. Commit to one and spend your time really learning how to use it effectively.*

???

Unless you've done a lot of coding in the past, you probably won't really know
the difference when you start out anyway. My arbitrary recommendations:
- easiest path? Notepad++
- best middle ground path? Sublime Text/VS Code
- feeling adventurous? vim
